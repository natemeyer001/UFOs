To filter by date, click the white box below "Enter a Date". Note: there is a value showing of 1/10/2010 which is just a placeholder to show the desired format of filters. After clicking in the box enter a date using the DD/MM/YYYY format and hit enter. Since the table is dynamic, it will quickly change to display only values that match your filter. Entering 1/2/2010 produces the following result.

To undo a filter, delete the content from the white box. Once the filter field is removed, the table will reload with the remaining filter(s) in place as pictured below.

Note: you can add more than one filter for the table. Each time you enter a new filter or remove a filter, the table will dynamically display the updated table. In the example above with January 2nd 2010 we got 8 different entries in the table. We can add another filter to get sphere shape sightings, which narrows it down to only 2 entries now as pictured below.
